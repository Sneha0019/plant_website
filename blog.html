        <h2> Ayurveda at a Glance</h2>
        <p>Ayurveda, an ancient system of medicine originating in India, is based on the belief that our well-being is deeply connected to the balance of three vital energies or "doshas" within us: Vata (air and space), Pitta (fire and water), and Kapha (earth and water). These doshas govern our physical, mental, and emotional characteristics. Ayurvedic remedies, including the use of specific plants, aim to restore balance to these doshas.</p>
